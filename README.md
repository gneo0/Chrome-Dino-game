# Chrome Dino
A `<canvas>` element based project. I chose this project to learn about how to draw graphics/images into the web and solve one of the most common techniques used to provide collision detection in 2D games ([Axis-Aligned Bounding Box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection#axis-aligned_bounding_box "Read about Axis-Aligned Bounding Box")).
